    <h1>Welcome to the Mill Game Rules</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Mill Game, also known as Nine Men's Morris, is a strategic board game that has been played for centuries. It's a two-player game where the goal is to form mills (three pieces in a row) and remove your opponent's pieces. Here are the basic rules:</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>The game is played on a grid with 24 points connected by lines. Each player has 9 pieces of a different color. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board until all pieces are placed.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The main goal is to form mills by placing three of your pieces in a row horizontally or vertically. When a mill is formed, you can remove one of your opponent's pieces from the board. The player who reduces their opponent to only two pieces or immobilizes their opponent's pieces wins the game.</p>

    <h2>Moving Pieces</h2>
    <p>Once all pieces are on the board, players take turns moving one piece along a line to an adjacent point. You cannot jump over other pieces, and you cannot break an opponent's mill unless there are no other options.</p>

    <h2>Endgame</h2>
    <p>When a player has only three pieces left, they can move them to any empty point on the board. If they form a mill, they can remove one of the opponent's pieces. The game continues until one player wins as described above.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Now that you know the basic rules of the Mill Game, it's time to start playing and honing your strategy! Have fun and enjoy this classic board game.</p>
